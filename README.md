Golinks
=======

Golinks is a tiny url shortnet server that uses sqlite database. This is purely
meant for my personal use and you are more than welcome to use it too.

Build
=====

After you have downloaded all the dependencies, you can now build and run it.

```bash
$ got get github.com/maxking/golinks
$ cd $GOPATH/src/maxking/golinks
$ go build
```

Running
=======

Just execute the binary to start the running server:

```bash
$ ./golinks
```
